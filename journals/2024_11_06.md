# Meeting Summary with Mr. Jihad Al-Mathani

Had a meeting with Mr. Jihad Al-Mathani (أ. جهاد المطحني) regarding the technical reports. He expressed feeling discouraged about the project's current state and needs time to regain his motivation. Currently, he has no clear vision for rebuilding the project or restructuring the team.

I informed him about the HR Manager's role and the support they can provide, particularly with:
- Team restructuring assistance
- Employee management guidance
- Organizational development support
  
  **Key Points:**
- Needs time to rebuild motivation
- Lacks clear project rebuilding strategy
- Suggests seeking consultation (استشارة) from established programming companies
- Discussed HR Manager's potential involvement in resolving team-related challenges
